                            The “new ’20s” idea might not work—there were a lot more young people in the United States
                            then than now; a reprise of the world-changing inventions and discoveries of the 1920s would
                            be a big surprise to those economists who believe that we have been in an invention dry
                            spell since the 1970s. In his Businessweek piece, Peter Coy largely agrees, writing, “In all

                            These experts make strong cases, and they satisfy my natural instinct not to go there. But I
                            remain very interested in the reasons the ’20s appeal to our imagination right now. Of
                            course, it’s the booze, the sex, and the parties. But it’s also a decade with a very strong
                            identity—and I think that helps. Writing in the journal American Speech in 1951, Mamie J.
                            Meredith argued that the ’20s boasted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’d argue that Meredith’s point about the decade’s exceptionality still holds: How many
                            other 20th century decades have a nice little permanent descriptor like Roaring? It helps
                            that most of these are good adjectives, evoking a time you’d probably like to live through
                            again—but even the slightly dangerous-sounding ones conjure up something specific. That
                            definiteness offers an appealing sense

                            Anyway, let’s get to that fun. A very joyful book to read about the decade is Frederick
                            Lewis Allen’s Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s, which Allen—a blueblood
                            journalist and editor at Harper’s—published in 1931. The book chronicles all of the movement
                            and motion that makes the decade sexy, and doesn’t seem to miss a fad.

                            Allen is also really good at describing parties—or, at least, the ones the middle class and
                            upper class attended. The historian wrote about how women taking up smoking had “strewed the
                            dinner table with their ashes, snatched a puff between the acts, invaded the masculine
                            sanctity of the club car.
